Automation


You work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.

Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.

A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.

Every week, you need to know:

- What video categories were trending last week?
- How were they distributed among various regions?
- What categories were especially popular in the United States?
